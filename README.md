    ]
}

2. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students common to a given list of teachers (i.e. retrieve students who are registered to ALL of the given teachers).
-	Endpoint: GET /api/commonstudents
-	Success response status: HTTP 200
-	Request example 1: GET /api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken%40gmail.com
-	Success response body 1:
```
{
  "students" :
    [
      "commonstudent1@gmail.com", 
      "commonstudent2@gmail.com",
      "student_only_under_teacher_ken@gmail.com"
    ]
}
```
-	Request example 2: GET /api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken%40gmail.com&teacher=teacherjoe%40gmail.com
-	Success response body 2:
```
{
  "students" :
    [
      "commonstudent1@gmail.com", 
      "commonstudent2@gmail.com"
    ]
}
```

3. As a teacher, I want to suspend a specified student.
-	Endpoint: POST /api/suspend
-	Headers: Content-Type: application/json
-	Success response status: HTTP 204
-	Request body example:
```
{
  "student" : "studentmary@gmail.com"
}
```

4. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students who can receive a given notification.
- A notification consists of:
  -	the teacher who is sending the notification, and
  -	the text of the notification itself.
- To receive notifications from e.g. 'teacherken@gmail.com', a student:
  -	MUST NOT be suspended,
  -	AND MUST fulfill AT LEAST ONE of the following:
    - is registered with â€œteacherken@gmail.com"
    -	has been @mentioned in the notification
- The list of students retrieved should not contain any duplicates/repetitions.
  -	Endpoint: POST /api/retrievefornotifications
  -	Headers: Content-Type: application/json
  -	Success response status: HTTP 200
  -	Request body example 1:
```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hello students! @studentagnes@gmail.com @studentmiche@gmail.com"
}
```
  -	Success response body 1:
```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@gmail.com",
      "studentagnes@gmail.com", 
      "studentmiche@gmail.com"
    ]   
}
```
In the example above, studentagnes@gmail.com and studentmiche@gmail.com can receive the notification from teacherken@gmail.com, regardless whether they are registered to him, because they are @mentioned in the notification text. studentbob@gmail.com however, has to be registered to teacherken@gmail.com.
  -	Request body example 2:
```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hey everybody"
}
```
  -	Success response body 2:
```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@gmail.com"
    ]   
}
```

### Error Responses
For all the above API endpoints, error responses should:
-	have an appropriate HTTP response code

```
